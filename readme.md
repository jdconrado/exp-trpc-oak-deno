Next Steps to Enhance Framework Development
Integration of tRPC:

Implement tRPC's core functionalities to enable type-safe communication between the server and client.
Integrate automatic endpoint generation with controllers using tRPC, leveraging its procedural communication style.
Improve Type Safety:

Refactor current interfaces and classes to utilize more advanced TypeScript 5 features, like template literal types and variadic tuple types.
Enhance generics in service methods for better type inference.
Adopt utility types to handle transformation and validation logic.
Transition from Reflect.metadata to the TypeScript 5 Decorators API:

Replace the existing decorators with the new TypeScript 5 Decorators API, improving performance and alignment with modern TypeScript standards.
Update decorator definitions to support the newer format, replacing Reflect.defineMetadata and related methods.
Ensure compatibility by providing a migration layer during the transition phase.
Leverage Deno 2's Enhanced Features:

Adapt the framework to Deno 2's improved ES module imports and optimized runtime behavior.
Use Denoâ€™s native bundling and testing tools to improve module loading and reduce startup times.
Refactor Dependency Injection:

Replace tsyringe with a Deno-native DI solution, or extend the current DI container to support more advanced scoping and lifecycle management.
Implement singleton, transient, and scoped providers to improve modularity.
Integrate Middleware for Enhanced Request Handling:

Add support for middleware chaining with Deno Oak, allowing pre- and post-processing for requests.
Use middleware for input validation, authentication, and error handling, maintaining modularity.
Add More Robust Error Handling:

Implement centralized error handling that uses Oak's built-in error middleware capabilities.
Extend the controller methods to include try-catch blocks or a global error handler for improved error traceability.
Testing and CI/CD Setup:

Introduce automated testing using Deno's built-in testing library and coverage tools.
Set up a CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions or another Deno-compatible CI system for automated builds and testing.
Improve Documentation and Developer Experience:

Update code comments and README with instructions for setting up and using the framework.
Add examples to demonstrate integration with tRPC, decorators, and service methods.
Create a CLI for Easy Scaffolding:

Build a CLI that can scaffold modules, services, controllers, and routes based on pre-defined templates.
Implement commands for spinning up the server, generating entities, and configuring services.
These improvements will make the framework more robust, aligned with modern standards, and easier to use for developers familiar with Deno, Nest.js, and TypeScript.
